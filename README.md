# Description
Fodder is a chess engine operating under the UCI protocol. Fodder is not a complete chess program and requires an external GUI to function.
All features are listed in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/nekSaikou/Fodder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in chronological order.

## Compilation
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nekSaikou/Fodder
$ cd Fodder
$ ./build.sh
```
### Requirements
Fodder does not have any external dependencies and can be compiled with a C++ compiler. Fodder's default compiler is Clang++. If you want to use another compiler, you can manually modify [build.sh](https://github.com/nekSaikou/Fodder/blob/master/build.sh).
